## Abstract
What is leadership? That term gets thrown around a lot, but what is it really? What do leaders do that makes them leaders? Leadership can be learned and that is good as leaders are in high demand and in short supply.

The parallels between military leadership and leading software development teams are striking, emphasizing the importance of traits such as integrity, decisiveness, and dependability. This conference session aims to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate worlds by introducing attendees to the 14 Marine Corps Leadership Traits and demonstrating their practical application in software development leadership.

The session will provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental distinctions between a boss or manager and a true leader. Attendees will learn that leadership is not just about authority, but about inspiring, guiding, and empowering team members to achieve their fullest potential. Through real-world examples and interactive exercises, participants will gain actionable insights into fostering a culture of collaboration, innovation, and accountability within their software development teams.

By merging the values and practices of the United States Marine Corps with the nuances of software development leadership, this session equips attendees with a unique toolkit to lead their teams with confidence and purpose. Whether you are a seasoned leader or embarking on your leadership journey, this session promises to inspire and empower you to lead your software development teams to new heights of success.
